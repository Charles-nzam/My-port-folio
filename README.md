# My-port-folio
Hello readers and viewersðŸ‘‹
My name is Charles nzam as shown on my page.
My portfolio is a website that entails details about me and my work,my interests in coding and all others.
It's quite fun learning how to code and this is actually my first code work I've done hoping to do more in the future with good study and practice.
The codes above displays more on how I've come about creating this portfolio.I will definitely have more projects to work on and of course these projects will be displayed right here on git hub.
Hope you have fun scrolling through my page.
Thank you!
